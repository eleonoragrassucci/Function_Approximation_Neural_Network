# Function approximation with Neural Network (MLP and RBF)
#### Eleonora Grassucci, Daniele Mocavini, Dario Stagnitto

The aim of this project is to approximate a function by a Neural Network.

**Point 1.1**: we implemented a Full MLP Network with one hidden layer and 21 neurons.

**Point 1.2**: we implemented a Full RBF Network with one hidden layer and 50 neurons.

**Point 2.1**: we implemented an Extreme Learning procedure for MLP.

**Point 2.2**: we implemented an unsupervised centers selection for RBF.

**Point 3**: we implemented a Two Block Decomposition for RBF.
